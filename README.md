## Simplified trello-like kanban board with normalized state
[Demo](https://agentboo.github.io/react-kanban-normalized).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap)

Uses [React DnD](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd) and [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) store to handle app state and drag and drop actions.  
[Redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) middleware and [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr) are used to manage async fetching and normalizing api responses from a fake-backend script.
